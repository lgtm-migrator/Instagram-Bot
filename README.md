## Instagram Bot

```app.py``` will let you scrap through all instagram posts containing a hashtag, and like them for you! Replace the username and password at ```user = InstagramBot('username', 'password')``` and run the function.

**Note**: Instagram will probably shut down your account, if you are liking posts more than average. I would not let this run for more than 100 posts a day to not get banned.


### Pre-req:
---
1. ```$ pip install selenium```
2. [Gecko driver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) installed in python's directory (```$ which python``` to check the installed directory)
